###project must incorporate:
- non-trivial 3D modeling,
- moving through a complex scene,
- animation,
- lighting,
- texture mapping,
- ray casting (a simplified form of ray tracing)
- shadows
- reflections



###Implementation:
- We are going to model a mansion with rooms and furniture
- The player should be able to move throughout the mansion in a realistic manner.
- Animation will be used throughout the game to show the player/camera moving throughout the environment as well as for various objects around the mansion that will move around.
-The environment will have lighting to simulate dimmed lights throughout the mansion, possibly candles, and occasional bursts of lightning.
- We will have walls and objects will have textures to make the mansion look more realistic.
- Ray casting will be used to implement collision detection allowing the player to move around the mansion without walking through walls or other objects.
- Because there will be lighting from various sources we will need to also render shadows.
- We will have a mirror
